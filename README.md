# MP0-leivathan-copy
This is my (Andrew Kim's) copy of Machine Project 0, Triple Crown, for the Spring 2018 semester of CS 125, Introduction to Computer Science, at the University of Illinois.
The purpose of this project was to provide a simple introduction into coding through three simple tasks: determining two numbers' least common multiple, returning the greatest number of the last N values of an array of floats, and computing the score of a short quiz.
Code which I (Andrew Kim) worked on is marked by commits that start with "added email, changed LCM return type." More information on the project can be found here: https://cs125.cs.illinois.edu/MP/2018/spring/0/
